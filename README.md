RNASeq-methods-comparison
=========================

This project aims to compare the results of biological network analysis
from RNASeq data using gene models from following methods:
* Tophat/Cufflinks (with and without integration of Ensembl gene models)
* _De novo_ assembly
* _De novo_ assembly + local assembly (reference guided)
* Ensembl predicted gene models
